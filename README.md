## This is a simple WebApp "about me" that I have taken inspiration from ![alt text](https://deepanshsachdeva.github.io/) 
and tweaked a bit, portfolio websites are a great way to explain about one's-self I did not want to have the mainstream one so I built the chatbot 
version for portfolio uses a vue widget and simple 50 lines of code to show the personal deatils.
